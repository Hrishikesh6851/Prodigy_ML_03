# 🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Classification using SVM - Prodigy ML 03

This project classifies images of cats and dogs using classical machine learning — specifically, Support Vector Machines (SVM) with PCA for dimensionality reduction. 
It serves as a baseline approach before transitioning to more advanced deep learning techniques.
